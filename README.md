# Functional Reactive Programming Resources
A chronological collection of academic resources on the practice of functional reactive programming. Great care has been taken to respect copyrights â€” no files are directly hosted and only links to original (open-access) sources are provided instead. Please read [License & Important Notice](https://gitlab.com/-/ide/project/andersyr/frp-resources/edit/main/-/README.md#license-important-notice) for more copyright information.

Project Status: Active as of June 2022.

Resources are kept on a separate page. Checkout the [Functional Reactive Programming Resources]()!

## Reading and Coding Group
This repository has a subchannel within the [Functional Programming discord](https://discord.gg/EYyhYrr2gF). Regardless of your experience level, please feel free to join in on weekly reading goals, discussions, and the practices of FRP programming.

## List of Authors
This is an incomplete (and in-construction) list of authors in the research field of functional reactive programming, organized by publication date. This list is intended as a tribute of appreciation to the original source authors for their contributions to advancing the field. Thank you for your efforts and work.

(TODO; list to be properly constructed).

## Motivation
To understand a field, subfield, or topic of research is a daunting task:

- Formal research is published across many different publications and research within publications are rarely organized by specific topic;
- Metanalyses and surveys exist, however they include theory by the author and are restricted by academic rigor to not include informal educational resources;
- Informal educational resources are likewise published in many places, in many types of media, and not many places collect and organize those resources;
- Rarely do sources exist that can give an understanding of how a field of research has evolved over time both formally *and* informally;
- Most methods of organizing research either do not provide a way for- or have barriers that unintentionally prevent- community contribution, which severely hinders the task of staying current with the research.
- Tools exist to explore formal academic citations, however they are often limited by focusing on individual papers instead of topic.
- No tools exist that explore citations for informal educational resource.

Public repositories are a possible solution to many of these problems, until a better tool comes along: 
- Formal academic citations can be collected and organized across publications by the specific research topic.
- Informal educational resource citations can be collected and organized regardless of media type and academic rigor.
- Community contribution can be encouraged with [forming issues](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/managing_issues.html) and by [merge-requests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/creating_merge_requests.html).

## Possible Community Goal
A possible community goal to practice applying learned FRP programming skills could be to build a [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) FRP-GUI application that allows one to explore graphs connecting both formal and informal research citations.

## Contributing
**Missing publication:** If there are publications not included in this list, please create a [gitlab issue](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/managing_issues.html#from-an-issue-board) on the [missing publication]() issue board with as much information as you can provide and the main repository will be updated as soon as possible. Alternatively, feel free to create a [merge request](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/creating_merge_requests.html).

**Citation Typo:** Please file an issue on the [citation typo]() issue board for misstyped citations. Formatting will default to (TODO; decide default citation format) if the original source does not have a formal citation format.
